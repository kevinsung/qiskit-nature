    Adds utilities to perform the low rank decomposition of a molecular Hamiltonian,
    as described in `arXiv:1808.02625 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02625>`_ and
    `arXiv:2104.08957 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08957>`_.
    These utilities are exposed as
    :func:`.low_rank_decomposition` and :func:`.low_rank_z_representation`.
